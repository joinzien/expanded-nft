# Expanded NFTs

Based on the [Zora NFT Editions](https://github.com/ourzora/nft-editions) contracts.

## What are these contracts?

1. `ExpandedNFT`
   Each drop is a unique contract.
   This allows for easy royalty collection, clear ownership of the collection, and your own contract ðŸŽ‰
2. `DropCreator`
   Gas-optimized factory contract allowing you to easily + for a low gas transaction create your own drop mintable contract.
3. `SharedNFTLogic`
   Contract that includes dynamic metadata generation for your editions removing the need for a centralized server.
   imageUrl and animationUrl can be base64-encoded data-uris for these contracts totally removing the need for IPFS
